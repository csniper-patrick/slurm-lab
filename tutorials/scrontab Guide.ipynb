    "# `scrontab` Guide\n",
    "`scrontab` lets a user submit recurring jobs to the Slurm cluster, similar to, as you can tell from the name, a cron job in Linux. One major difference between a cron job and a `scrontab` recurring job is that a cron job is expected to run at around the scheduled time, but the `scrontab` job only starts queuing at the scheduled time. Only after the current run has finished will the next run be queued. So if you want your `scrontab` job to run on time, you might need to consider dedicating some resources to it.  \n",

    "reference: [scrontab - manpage](/doc/scrontab.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this guide, it is better and easier to edit the `scrontab` jobs interactively. You can open a terminal alongside this notebook to try out the examples. "
