    "# `scrontab` Guide\n",
    "scrontab let user submit recurring jobs to the slurm cluster, similar to, as you can tell from the name, a cronjob in Linux. One major difference between a cronjob and a scrontab recurring job is that a cronjob is expected to run at around the scheduled time, but the scrontab job is only start queuing at the scheduled time, and only until the current run has finished, the next run will be queued. So if you want your scrontab job to run on time, you might need to consider dedicating some resource to it.  \n",
